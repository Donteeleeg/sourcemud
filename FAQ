Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------------------------------

1. I found a bug!  How do I report it?
   ===================================

   Please report any bugs to the Bugs Forum, which can be found at
   http://forums.awemud.net.

2. What are the software does AweMUD require?
   ==========================================

   In order to build AweMUD, you need very little external software.  Your
   standard build tools (compiler, make tool, UNIX shell tools, etc.) are a
   necessity.  Specifically, you need a GNU Make compatible make program, and
   the GCC C++ compiler (version 3.3 or higher), with an up-to-date STL
   implementation.

   The only external library required by AweMUD is the Boehm GC.  When
   compiling and installing the Boehm GC, be sure to pass the
   --enable-cplusplus option to the ./configure script.

   The xsltproc utility is required for generating some of the source code.
   The utility is distributed as part of libxslt.

   In order to build the documentation, you will need a properly installed
   xmlto with a full set of DocBook XML stylesheets.

   If you want to work on AweMUD as a coder, you'll likely also need the GNU
   autotools, specifically automake and autoconf.  You'll also need xsltproc
   for building the scripting interface.  Finally, you'll need GNU Bison and
   Flex.

   Package Websites:
   GNU Autoconf... http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
   GNU Automake... http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
   GNU Bison...... http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/
   GNU Flex....... http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/
   Boehm GC....... http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/
   xmlto.......... http://cyberelk.net/tim/xmlto/
   xsltproc....... http://www.xmlsoft.org

   All of these packages come standard with popular GNU/Linux and UNIX
   operating systems.  For the Boehm GC, make sure you have the development
   packages installed in addition to the core library package.

3. Why won't AweMUD build on Mac OS X?
   ===================================

   If you are using Mac OS X, you must install a UNIX software support system
   such as Fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net).  If you are using Fink,
   libtool14 and libxslt installed.  You also must perform additional
   configuration after installing Fink to compile applications.
   (See http://fink.sourceforge.net/faq/usage-general.php#compile-myself)
   These instructions have a slight typo, however.  Change the line
     AC_LOCAL="-I/sw/share/aclocal"
   to
     AC_LOCAL="-I /sw/share/aclocal"
   That added space after the -I is required.  If you modify the configure.ac
   or other build files, you'll have to re-run the ./bootstrap script,
   otherwise the aclocal script may fail.

4. Why won't AweMUD build on Windows?
   ==================================

   Windows (including Cygwin) is not a supported platform of AweMUD.

   Patches to get AweMUD to compile or run on Windows/Cygwin are quite
   welcome, however.

5. AweMUD won't compile with GCC 2.9x!?
   ====================================

   AweMUD only supports GCC versions 3.3 and higher.

6. How come AweMUD doesn't work after 'make install'?
   ==================================================

   Make sure that the settings in the installed awemud.conf file are
   correct for your system.

7. How can I help?
   ===============

   AweMUD is in a constant state of development, and could its developers
   could use assistance in many areas.  Coders, testers, and documentation
   writers are all welcome to join the AweMUD project.

   Feel free to ask for guidance or suggestions on the AweMUD forums at
   http://forums.awemud.net or on the AweMUD development mailing list at
   http://groups.google.com/group/awemud-devel.
