Basic Source MUD Information
------------------------------------------------------


1. Introduction
   ============
   Source MUD is a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) game server.  Players connect to
   the server using telnet, or a MUD client application, to play in a fantasy
   world with other players.

   Source MUD is a new codebase; it is not derived from any older codebases
   like many other popular MUDs.  One consequence of this is that many terms
   and systems found in most other MUDs are different in Source MUD.

   The Scriptix scripting language is used to extending and modifying the
   engine core features.


2. Documentation
   =============
   The files in the doc/ directory contain lots of useful information.  If you
   received Source MUD in a pre-packaged form, there should be both plain text
   and HTML versions of all the documents.  If those files are not present, and
   you have tools for DocBook XML processing installed, the files will be built
   when you run 'make'.

   Please note that the coders tend to get out of sync with the document
   writers (even when they are usually the same person), and the documents
   often lag behind the code.


3. Support
   =======
   If the documentation doesn't provide an answer, or just confused you more,
   you can find support in several place.  The Source MUD website
   (http://www.sourcemud.org) has both user forums and a bug tracking system.
   The website also has information on the Source MUD mailing lists.


4. Upgrading
   =========
   If you are upgrading from a previous Source MUD release, please keep these
   points in mind:

   * Be warned that 'make install' will overwrite several key files in the
	 target directory, including sourcemud.conf, and all the files in data/*.
	 You should back up your modified copies, or manually install the Source
	 MUD files you wish to upgrade.
   * Read the ChangeLog and script documentation before running the new Source
   * MUD
	 with your old scripts.  Pre-1.0 Source MUD releases are very likely to
	 change the API exposed the scripts.
   * Data files may very likely need to be modified, converted, or flat out
	 rewritten.  While we try to stay compatible between pre-1.0 release, it
	 doesn't make sense to limit development of features for compatibility
	 reasons in alpha software.


5. Legal
