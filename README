Basic AweMUD NG Information
------------------------------------------------------


1. Introduction
   ============
   AweMUD NG is a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) game server.  Players connect to the
   server using telnet, or a MUD client application, to play in a fantasy world
   with other players.

   AweMUD NG is a new codebase; it is not derived from any older codebases like
   many other popular MUDs.  One consequence of this is that many terms and
   systems found in most other MUDs are different in AweMUD.

   The Scriptix scripting language is used to extending and modifying the
   engine core features.


2. Documentation
   =============
   The files in the doc/ directory contain lots of useful information.  If you
   received AweMUD in a pre-packaged form, there should be both plain text and
   HTML versions of all the documents.  If those files are not present, and you
   have tools for DocBook XML processing installed, the files will be built
   when you run 'make'.

   In particular, building and installation instructions can be found in the
   admin guide (e.g. doc/admin.txt), along with basic configuration details.

   Useful guides for players (who probably won't even be reading this file), an
   administration guide, FAQ file, scripting API reference (for the AweMUD-
   specific APIs), and more are located in doc/.

   Please note that the coders tend to get out of sync with the document
   writers (even when they are usually the same person), and the documents
   often lag behind the code.


3. Support
   =======
   If the documentation doesn't provide an answer, or just confused you more,
   you can find support in several place.  The AweMUD website
   (http://www.awemud.net) has both user forums and a bug tracking system.  The
   website also has information on the AweMUD mailing lists.  You can also
   (occasionally) find people in the #awemud channel on the FreeNode IRC
   network.


4. Upgrading
   =========
   If you are upgrading from a previous AweMUD release, please keep these
   points in mind:

   * Be warned that 'make install' will overwrite several key files in the
     target directory, including awemud.conf, and all the files in data/*.  You
     should back up your modified copies, or manually install the AweMUD files
     you wish to upgrade.
   * Read the ChangeLog and script documentation before running the new AweMUD
     with your old scripts.  Pre-1.0 AweMUD releases are very likely to change
     the API exposed the scripts.
   * Data files may very likely need to be modified, converted, or flat out
     rewritten.  While we try to stay compatible between pre-1.0 release, it
     doesn't make sense to limit development of features for compatibility
     reasons in alpha software.
