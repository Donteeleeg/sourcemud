#### AweMUD Skill List

# Intrinsic skills:
#  These skills are core attributes of all characters.  Intrinsic skills are
#  assigned at character creation, and they are displayed to the user with the
#  'stats' command instead of the normal 'skills' command.  Furthermore, they
#  cannot be improved using the normal skill purchase method.

# Restricted skills:
#  Restricted skills cannot be learned by buying the first rank in the skill,
#  but instead must be granted to the player by some other means, such as a
#  trainer or quest or something.  These skills are not shown in the
#  character's skill list unless they have at least one rank in the skill.

# Locked skills:
#  Locked skills cannot be improved using the normal purchase means, even if
#  the character already has ranks in the skill.

# Secret skills:
#  Secret skills are never shown in the character's skill list, even if they
#  have ranks in the skill.  They cannot be improved using normal purchase
#  means, even if the character already has ranks in the skill.
