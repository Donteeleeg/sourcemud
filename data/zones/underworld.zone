It is here that those who perish in the mortal realms come to await judgement.  Those faithful to their gods are taken to paradise, while those who failed their deity are taken to the tall, red towers stretching into the darkness above.  Wandering the streets of the city are the lost souls; those who never found a god to call their own, and are left to find paradise as they will in the bleak city, just as they did in life.  The spirits all avoid the wide river flowing through the center of the city, trembling in fear of it even as they cross the wide bridges spanning the black, murky water."
