Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------------------------------

1. I found a bug!  How do I report it?
   ===================================

   Please report any bugs to the Bugs Forum, which can be found at
   http://forums.sourcemud.org.

2. What are the software does Source MUD require?
   ==========================================

   In order to build Source MUD, you need very little external software.  Your
   standard build tools (compiler, make tool, UNIX shell tools, etc.) are a
   necessity.  Specifically, you need a GNU Make compatible make program, and
   the GCC C++ compiler (version 3.3 or higher), with an up-to-date STL
   implementation.

   The only external library required by Source MUD is the Boehm GC.  When
   compiling and installing the Boehm GC, be sure to pass the
   --enable-cplusplus option to the ./configure script.

   The xsltproc utility is required for generating some of the source code.
   The utility is distributed as part of libxslt.

   In order to build the documentation, you will need a properly installed
   xmlto with a full set of DocBook XML stylesheets.

   If you want to work on Source MUD as a coder, you'll likely also need the
   GNU autotools, specifically automake and autoconf.  You'll also need
   xsltproc for building the scripting interface.  Finally, you'll need GNU
   Bison and Flex.

   Package Websites:
   GNU Autoconf... http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
   GNU Automake... http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
   GNU Bison...... http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/
   GNU Flex....... http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/
   Boehm GC....... http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/
   xmlto.......... http://cyberelk.net/tim/xmlto/
   xsltproc....... http://www.xmlsoft.org

   All of these packages come standard with popular GNU/Linux and UNIX
   operating systems.  For the Boehm GC, make sure you have the development
   packages installed in addition to the core library package.

3. How come Source MUD doesn't work after 'make install'?
   ==================================================

   Make sure that the settings in the installed sourcemud.conf file are
   correct for your system.

4. How can I help?
   ===============

   Source MUD is in a constant state of development, and could its developers
   could use assistance in many areas.  Coders, testers, and documentation
   writers are all welcome to join the Source MUD project.
