1. Introduction
   ============

   AweMUD has a sub-system which is concerned with simulating the environment;
   i.e., weather.  Varying weather allows for a more realistic and interesting
   game system.

2. Design Goals
   ============
   
   First, we want weather to vary by season.  It should be cold and snowy in
   winter, and hot and dry in summer.  At least, in some regions.  Another
   design goal is to offer separate climates.  After all, the weather in a
   desert is much different than that high in the mountains.  Finally, we need
   disparate areas to have different weather states.  By that, I mean that if
   we have two temperate regions, one may be sunny while the other rainy.

3. Climates and Regions
   ====================

   The weather system will be broken into climates.  Each climate will be
   comprised of several weather patterns, based on season.  For example, a
   moderate climate may have snowy and cloudy patterns for winter, and sunny
   and rainy patterns for summer.

   A region will be, simply, a weather state and a climate.  Each region is in
   one climate and one climate only (altho many regisions may have the same
   climate).  Regions have indepdent states.  A region's state is, basically,
   the current pattern (and stage) the region is in, along with same basic
   book keeping information.  (Like timing before the weather changes again.)

4. Weather Patterns
   ================

   Patterns are a single type of weather.  For example, a rainy pattern, or a
   snowy pattern.

   Each pattern is comprised of one or more (usually several) stages.  Stages
   vary in severity.  Lighter severity stages have no impact on gameplay; they
   are just flavour.  Mid-range severity has a light impact on gameplay; such
   as reduced visibility or movement.  High-range severity has a big impact on
   gameplay; greatly limited vision or movement, environmental damage to
   equipment and possibly very light damage to people.  Finally, extreme
   severity is completely unsafe for people, as it results in lots of damage.

   An example pattern is rainy.  At the low severity ranges, it may be
   drizzling or lightly raining.  In mid-range severity, it could be pouring
   and perhaps light thunderstorming, with heavy wind.  High range severity
   would be heavily pouring rain/hail, lots of lightning and thunder, and high
   speed wind.  Extreme severity might have lots of hail, terrible lightning,
   and deadly winds.

5. Stage and Pattern Selection
   ===========================

   More severe stages are more and more rare.  The chances of weather turning
   to an extreme severity stage in any pattern is much much much lower than a
   light severity stage being used.

   Each pattern in a climate also has a varying chance of being selected.  For
   example, a thunderstorm in winter is much rarer than a snow storm.
   However, it's still possible.  Likewise, rain in a desert is very very
   rare, but also still possible.
