1. Introduction
   ============
   AweMUD uses an event message system to control behavior of game entities.

2. Event Types
   ===========
   There are three types of events.

   - Requests.  When some type of action is being attempted, a request event
     is first sent to the involved entities, the current room, and the current
	 zone.  A request event handler must return a boolean value.  If a false
	 value is returned, no further event handlers are called, and the calling
	 code should cease any further processing of the action.  This is used to
	 cancel the action.  The handler which returns the false event should
	 display a message to the actor that invoked the action.
   - Notification.  After an action is performed, a notification event is sent
     to the current room, every creature and object in that room, and the
	 current zone.  There is no return value for a notification event.
   - Commands.  A command event is sent only to a single game entity, the
     command's recipient.  A command event tells the entity to perform some
	 particular action.  The command event handler returns a boolean value,
	 with a true response indicating that the command was successfully
	 carried out.
