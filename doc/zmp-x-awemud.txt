AweMUD ZMP Package
==================

Package Name: x-awemud

x-awemud.name
-------------

Sends the name of the game as a single argument.  Client can use this to
display to the user or for saving the session information.

x-awemud.status.create
----------------------

Create a new status bar.  Takes three arguments.

First argument is a unique ID.  This ID may be any string, and must be
unique among all status bars defined by the server.

Second argument is a title.  This title is intended to be displayed to the
user, although the display is entirely up to the client behaviour.

Third argument is a type.  Must be one of 'fraction', 'percent', or 'count'.
This indicates how the progress bar value is displayed to the user.  Fraction
shows current/max (ex: 7/10).  Percent shows the fraction as a precent (ex:
70%).  Count simply shows the current value, but not the max (ex: 7).

x-awemud.status.set
-------------------

Sets the value of a status bar previously defined by the server with
x-awemud.status.create.  Takes three arguments.

First is the unique ID of a status bar as defined by the first argument of a
previous x-awemud.status.create command.

Second is the current value of the status bar amount.  This number must be a
non-negative integer.

Third value is the current maximum value of the status bar.  This number must
be a non-negative integer that is equal to or larger than the value of the
second argument.  Zero is allowed, and indicates and empty status bar.
